# ATM_Machine_Simulation

1. Simulated the working of an ATM System using Java with features like user login, balance check, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history.
2. Used core Data Structures like HashMap and ArrayList.
    HashMap to manage user accounts.
    ArrayList to keep track of the transaction history of the user.
    Used loops and conditionals to build this project. 
4. Implemented such that the code can be run on the terminal.
